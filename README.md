# So what does the bot do?

Great question! it delivers positive comments to the game you're targeting and I might add it for chat messages too to comment the player who friended the bot.

# Usage

Use it by putting in your bot account and password into the function parameters and put in a game ID.
After that for the fourth paramater, it will automatically put in a random comment from your JSON file to the message and then it sends positive comments every minute or so but you can change it if you want to make it post every 5 minutes or even once.

# Bot sample

I created a bot to spread positivity across KoGaMa so here's the bot: https://www.kogama.com/profile/670375609/. Feel free to friend the bot if you want some positivity in your life!
